    "A: We start with 15 trees. Later we have 21 trees. The difference must be the number of trees they planted. So, they must have planted 21 - 15 = 6 trees. The answer is 6.\n",

    "Q: If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?\n",
    "A: There are 3 cars in the parking lot already. 2 more arrive. Now there are 3 + 2 = 5 cars. The answer is 5.\n",

    "Q: Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42. If they ate 35, how many pieces do they have left in total?\n",
    "A: Leah had 32 chocolates and Leah's sister had 42. That means there were originally 32 + 42 = 74 chocolates. 35 have been eaten. So in total they still have 74 - 35 = 39 chocolates. The answer is 39.\n",

    "Q: Jason had 20 lollipops. He gave Denny some lollipops. Now Jason has 12 lollipops. How many lollipops did Jason give to Denny?\n",
    "A: Jason had 20 lollipops. Since he only has 12 now, he must have given the rest to Denny. The number of lollipops he has given to Denny must have been 20 - 12 = 8 lollipops. The answer is 8.\n",

    "Q: Shawn has five toys. For Christmas, he got two toys each from his mom and dad. How many toys does he have now?\n",
    "A: He has 5 toys. He got 2 from mom, so after that he has 5 + 2 = 7 toys. Then he got 2 more from dad, so in total he has 7 + 2 = 9 toys. The answer is 9.\n",

    "Q: Tina makes $18.00 an hour.  If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.  If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?\n",
    "A: Here's how to calculate Tina's earnings:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regular Time:**\n",
    "- Hours per shift: 8 hours\n",
    "- Wage per hour: $18.00\n",
    "- Regular pay per shift: 8 hours * $18.00/hour = $144.00\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overtime:**\n",
    "- Overtime hours per shift: 10 hours - 8 hours = 2 hours\n",
    "- Overtime pay per hour: $18.00 + ($18.00 / 2) = $27.00\n",
    "- Overtime pay per shift: 2 hours * $27.00/hour = $54.00\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total per day:**\n",
    "- Regular pay + overtime pay: $144.00/shift + $54.00/shift = $198.00/day\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total for 5 days:**\n",
    "- 5 days * $198.00/day = $990.00\n",

    "Q: Abigail is trying a new recipe for a cold drink. It uses 1/4 of a cup of iced tea and 1 and 1/4 of a cup of lemonade to make one drink. If she fills a pitcher with 18 total cups of this drink, how many cups of lemonade are in the pitcher?\n",
    "A: ## Ambiguity in the Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one main ambiguity in the problem statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total volume vs. Number of servings:** The statement \"18 total cups of this drink\" could be interpreted in two ways:\n",
    "  * **18 cups of the combined volume:** This would mean Abigail used a total of 18 cups of liquid, including both iced tea and lemonade.\n",
    "  * **18 individual servings:** This would mean Abigail made 18 individual drinks, each containing 1/4 cup of iced tea and 1 1/4 cup of lemonade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume the interpretation \"18 cups of the combined volume\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution assuming 18 cups of combined volume:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Find the proportion of lemonade in one drink:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lemonade: 1 1/4 cups\n",
    "* Iced tea: 1/4 cup\n",
    "* Total: 1 1/4 + 1/4 = 1 1/2 cups\n",
    "* Lemonade proportion: (1 1/4) / (1 1/2) = 5/6\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Calculate the amount of lemonade in the pitcher:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Total volume: 18 cups\n",
    "* Lemonade proportion: 5/6\n",
    "* Volume of lemonade: 18 * (5/6) = 15 cups\n",

    "Therefore, there are 15 cups of lemonade in the pitcher. The answer is 15.\n",

    "Q: A deep-sea monster rises from the waters once every hundred years to feast on a ship and sate its hunger. Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?\n",
    "A: Let us solve it using algebra. Let x be the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of people on the ship eaten in the second hundred years is 2x, and in the third hundred years is 4x.\n",

    "Therefore, the total number of people eaten over three hundred years is x + 2x + 4x = 847.\n",
