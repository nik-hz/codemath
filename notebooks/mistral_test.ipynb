    "\n",
    "**Regular Time:**\n",
    "- Hours per shift: 8 hours\n",
    "- Wage per hour: $18.00\n",
    "- Regular pay per shift: 8 hours * $18.00/hour = $144.00\n",

    "- Overtime hours per shift: 10 hours - 8 hours = 2 hours\n",
    "- Overtime pay per hour: $18.00 + ($18.00 / 2) = $27.00\n",
    "- Overtime pay per shift: 2 hours * $27.00/hour = $54.00\n",

    "A: ## Ambiguity in the Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one main ambiguity in the problem statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total volume vs. Number of servings:** The statement \"18 total cups of this drink\" could be interpreted in two ways:\n",
    "  * **18 cups of the combined volume:** This would mean Abigail used a total of 18 cups of liquid, including both iced tea and lemonade.\n",
    "  * **18 individual servings:** This would mean Abigail made 18 individual drinks, each containing 1/4 cup of iced tea and 1 1/4 cup of lemonade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume the interpretation \"18 cups of the combined volume\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution assuming 18 cups of combined volume:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Find the proportion of lemonade in one drink:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lemonade: 1 1/4 cups\n",
    "* Iced tea: 1/4 cup\n",
    "* Total: 1 1/4 + 1/4 = 1 1/2 cups\n",
    "* Lemonade proportion: (1 1/4) / (1 1/2) = 5/6\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Calculate the amount of lemonade in the pitcher:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Total volume: 18 cups\n",
    "* Lemonade proportion: 5/6\n",
    "* Volume of lemonade: 18 * (5/6) = 15 cups\n",

    "Q: A deep-sea monster rises from the waters once every hundred years to feast on a ship and sate its hunger. Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?\n",
    "A: Let us solve it using algebra. Let x be the number of people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years.\n",

    "The number of people on the ship eaten in the second hundred years is 2x, and in the third hundred years is 4x.\n",
