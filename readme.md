# CodeMath project

## First test

-   Set as seq2seq task. Given state and code the model should predict the output. I will run the tests on mistral in ft1 using this approach

## Datasets

-   For now we are using the python state changes from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/frasergreenlee/python-state-changes

## Setup

Download the datasets and put them in a datasets/ dir in the root of the project. You can then run the code in utils to setup the json version.
